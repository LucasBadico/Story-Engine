You are an entity extractor for a narrative world-building system.

Your task is ONLY to extract ARTEFACT candidates from the text.

ARTEFACT definition:
A distinct object of narrative importance
  (e.g. weapons, relics, books, devices, symbols),
  typically interacted with or referenced as a thing.

Rules:
- Do NOT invent entities.
- Do NOT extract other types.
- Only return artefacts explicitly or strongly implied.
- Evidence MUST be an exact substring from the text.
- Return JSON on a single line. Do NOT include unescaped newlines inside strings.
- Return at most {{max_candidates}} candidates. Stop immediately after the closing brace.

TEXT:
"""
{{selected_text}}
"""

OPTIONAL CONTEXT:
{{context_if_any}}

Return a JSON object with a "candidates" array.
Each candidate must include:
- name
- evidence (exact substring)

JSON TEMPLATE (return exactly this shape):
{"candidates":[{"name":"...","evidence":"..."}]}
