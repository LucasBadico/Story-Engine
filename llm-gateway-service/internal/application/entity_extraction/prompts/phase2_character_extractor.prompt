You are an entity extractor for a narrative world-building system.

Your task is ONLY to extract CHARACTER candidates from the text. 

Character definition:
A person or sentient being that performs actions, speaks, thinks,
  or is described as an individual agent.

Rules:
- Do NOT invent entities.
- Do NOT extract other types.
- Only return characters explicitly or strongly implied.
- Evidence MUST be an exact substring from the text.
- Prefer using already found entities when the mention refers to the same entity.
- Return JSON on a single line. Do NOT include unescaped newlines inside strings.
- Return at most {{max_candidates}} candidates. Stop immediately after the closing brace.

TEXT:
"""
{{selected_text}}
"""

OPTIONAL CONTEXT:
{{context_if_any}}

ALREADY FOUND:
{{already_found}}

Return a JSON object with a "candidates" array.
Each candidate must include:
- name
- evidence (exact substring)
- summary (short, grounded in text; update if this is the same entity as already found)

JSON TEMPLATE (return exactly this shape):
{"candidates":[{"name":"...","evidence":"...","summary":"..."}]}
